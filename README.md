# Secured Web Addressability Network (SWAN) 
Demo in go of SWAN, SWIFT and OWID

The SWAN demo implements the concepts explained in 
[SWAN](https://github.com/SWAN-community/swan)

The deployment guide later on in this readme shows you how to set up example 
with multiple SWIFT nodes, publishers and marketers but every SWAN needs at 
least the following:

* 5x SWIFT Nodes
* 1x SWAN Node
* 1x Publisher
* 1x Marketer

An example of nodes and members with example domain names:
```
             +-----------+  +-----------+  +-----------+
Swift        |           |  |           |  |           |
Storage      | 1.51da.uk |  | 2.51da.uk |  | 3.51da.uk |  ... etc
Nodes        |           |  |           |  |           |
             +-----------+  +-----------+  +-----------+

             +---------+  +---------+
Swan Nodes & |         |  |         |
Swift Access | 51da.uk |  | 51db.uk | ... etc
Nodes        |         |  |         |
             +---------+  +---------+

             |              |  |               |  |                |
             +--------------+  +---------------+  +----------------+
```
# Deployment

The demo currently supports the following environments:

* AWS Elastic Beanstalk
* Local Go SDK

And the following storage solutions:

* AWS Dynamo DB
* Azure Storage Tables

### Get the code

This demo uses submodules, to clone the repository and the submodules at the 
same time, run:

```
git clone --recurse-submodules https://github.com/SWAN-community/swan-demo-go
```

## Local Installation

### Prerequisites 

* Local Go version 1.15 or greater installation sufficient to run the Go command
line.

* Specified a storage option, the demo supports:
  * Azure Storage Tables
  * AWS DynamoDB

* For AWS, specify region and credentials in either environment variables or in 
`~/.aws/credentials` and `~/.aws/config` files. See 
[Configuring AWS SDK for Go](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/sdk-for-go/v1/developer-guide/configuring-sdk.html) to set up your environment. Make sure to set the 
`AWS_REGION`, `AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID` and `AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY` as a minimum.

* OR, for Azure Storage:
  
  Linux:
  ```bash
  export AZURE_STORAGE_ACCOUNT="<youraccountname>"
  export AZURE_STORAGE_ACCESS_KEY="<youraccountkey>"
  ```
  Windows:
  ```bat
  setx AZURE_STORAGE_ACCOUNT "<youraccountname>"
  setx AZURE_STORAGE_ACCESS_KEY "<youraccountkey>"
  ```

### Steps

* Having cloned the repository, configure the Go environment. If using Visual
Studio Code see `.vscode/launch.json.rename` for a template environment. Rename 
to remove the `rename` extension suffix. As this file will contain sensitive 
information it is exclude in .gitignore.

* Configure your hosts file to point URLs to localhost, see 
[Environments](#environments) section in this readme for platform specifics. 
The following host resolutions are used in the sample configuration:

  ```
  # domains from the www folder
  127.0.0.1	new-pork-limes.uk
  127.0.0.1	current-bun.uk
  127.0.0.1	cool-bikes.uk

  # Add more if your wish...
  ```

* To build on:
  * Linux: Run the `./build.sh` file if you are on Linux/MacOS or on 
  * Windows: First run `./dep.ps1` and then run the `./build.ps1` files.

* Run the server:

  ```
  ./src/server appsettings.dev.json
  ```

* The SWAN access nodes will be used to sign all the outgoing Open Web IDs and
also to capture people's preferences. Register this domain with the following
URL entering any of the details requested. This will create a record in the 
``owidcreators`` table for the domain which will contain randomly generated 
public and private signing keys.

  ```
  http://51da.uk/owid/register
  http://51db.uk/owid/register
  http://51dc.uk/owid/register
  http://51dd.uk/owid/register
  http://51de.uk/owid/register
  ```

* The other SWAN participant nodes will also need to be registered as Open Web
ID processors.

  http://new-pork-limes.uk/owid/register
  http://current-bun.uk/owid/register
  http://cool-bikes.uk/owid/register
  http://cool-cars.uk/owid/register
  http://cool-creams.uk/owid/register
  http://cmp.swan-demo.uk/owid/register
  http://swan-demo.uk/owid/register
  http://pop-up.swan-demo.uk/owid/register
  http://badssp.swan-demo.uk/owid/register
  http://bidswitch.swan-demo.uk/owid/register
  http://centro.swan-demo.uk/owid/register
  http://dataxu.swan-demo.uk/owid/register
  http://liveintent.swan-demo.uk/owid/register
  http://magnite.swan-demo.uk/owid/register
  http://mediamath.swan-demo.uk/owid/register

  http://zeta.swan-demo.uk/owid/register
  http://liveramp.swan-demo.uk/owid/register
  http://quantcast.swan-demo.uk/owid/register

* For each of the access and storage nodes that will be used for the SWIFT 
component of the demo register these using the following URL. Enter the network 
as "swan" (no quotes). The records from these steps will be visible in the 
``swiftnodes`` and ``swiftsecrets`` tables.

Access nodes

  ```
  http://51da.uk/swift/register
  http://51db.uk/swift/register
  http://51dc.uk/swift/register
  http://51dd.uk/swift/register
  http://51de.uk/swift/register
  ```

Storage nodes

  ```
  http://1.51da.uk/swift/register
  http://2.51da.uk/swift/register
  http://3.51da.uk/swift/register
  http://4.51da.uk/swift/register
  http://5.51da.uk/swift/register
  ```
* Now browse to one of the publisher URLs, you will be prompted to set your 
preferences:

  ```
  http://new-pork-limes.uk
  ```

# Files

`Procfile` : needed by AWS Elastic Beanstalk to indicate the application 
executable for web services.

`build.ps1` : builds AWS or Azure packages on Windows ready for manual deployment.

`build.sh` : builds AWS or Azure packages on Linux ready for manual deployment.

`dep.ps1` : gets SWAN demo dependencies on Windows.

`appsettings.json` : application settings for production.

`appsettings.dev.json` : application settings for development.

`.ebextensions/.config.rename` : AWS Elastic Beanstalk .config template ready for
additional SSL certificates.

`.vscode/launch.json.rename` : template Visual Studio Code launch settings 
including place holders for the storage environment variable values.

Note: `.gitignore` will ignore `launch.json`, and `.ebextensions/.config` to 
limit the risk of commits containing access keys.

# Environments

This demo makes extensive use of multiple domains. For development purposes 
setup local domains to resolve to 127.0.0.1.

## Windows 

```
notepad C:\Windows\System32\drivers\etc\hosts
```

## Linux

```
vi /etc/hosts
```

## AWS Elastic Beanstalk - without docker

### Prerequisites

* Local Go version 1.15 or greater installation sufficient to run the Go command
line.

* Familiar with the concepts associated with 
[SWAN](https://github.com/SWAN-community/swan),
[SWIFT](https://github.com/SWAN-community/swift), and 
[OWID](https://github.com/SWAN-community/owid).

* AWS account with Elastic Beanstalk and DynamoDB administration privileges or
Azure account with Storage and App Services.

#### AWS

* Setup domains to use with the demo in AWS using 
[Route 53](https://console.aws.amazon.com/route53). Domains are needed for the 
following roles.

    * SWAN access domain. For example ``51da.uk``.

    * Each of the SWIFT nodes that will support SWAN. At least two domains are 
    needed. For the purposes of the demo they may be sub domains. For example
    ``51da.uk`` and ``51db.uk``.

    * At least two different domains for publishers. For example 
    ``new-pork-limes.uk`` and ``current-bun.uk``.

    * At least two different domains for marketers. For example 
    ``cool-bikes.uk`` and ``cool-creams.uk``.

* Setup SSL certificates in AWS using 
[Certificate Manager](https://console.aws.amazon.com/acm/) 
for each of the domains.

#### Windows

* Set powershell unrestricted execution policy to enable `build.ps1` to execute.
  Use the following command with administrator privileges.

  `Set-ExecutionPolicy Unrestricted`

### Steps

* Get all the dependencies needed by the Go application.

  `go get -d ./...`

  `dep.ps1` can also be used in Powershell to explicitly get the dependencies 
  for this Go application.

* Add the demo domain names as folder names to the www folder. For example; the
domain `domain.com` would appear as `www/domain.com`. Alter the `config.json` 
content in each folder to indicate the purpose of the domain. This aspect of 
the demo is changing and domain examples provided with the should be reviewed 
along with the demo source code and comments to understand how multiple domains
are supported within a single demo application.

* You may need to support multiple SSL certificates if the demo deployment 
should respond to five or more domains. 
See AWS
[documentation](https://aws.amazon.com/premiumsupport/knowledge-center/elastic-beanstalk-ssl-load-balancer/).
Locate the ARN for each of the certificates that should be used with the demo.

* Add SSL certificate ARNs to a copy of ``.ebextensions/.config``. For example 
if you have the SSL ARNs A, B and C your .config file would contain the
following entries.

  ```
  option_settings:
    aws:elbv2:listener:443:
      Protocol: HTTPS
      SSLCertificateArns: "A"
  Resources:
    SSLCert2:
      Type: "AWS::ElasticLoadBalancingV2::ListenerCertificate"
      Properties:
        ListenerArn:
          Ref : "AWSEBV2LoadBalancerListener443"
        Certificates:
          - CertificateArn: "B"
    SSLCert3:
      Type: "AWS::ElasticLoadBalancingV2::ListenerCertificate"
      Properties:
        ListenerArn:
          Ref : "AWSEBV2LoadBalancerListener443"
        Certificates:
          - CertificateArn: "C"
  ```

* Run the build.ps1 (Windows) or build.sh (Linux) to create the 
``aws-eb-swan-demo.zip`` bundle. The bundle should contain the ``application`` 
executable compiled for Linux 64 bit, ``Procfile`` to tell Elastic Beanstalk how 
to start the application, ``.ebextensions/.config`` to configure additional
HTTPS listeners for additional domains and SSL certificates, and the ``www`` 
folder with directories for all the domains the demo will respond to. Note the
SWIFT domains used for storage do not need to be present in the www folder.

* Create a new Elastic Beanstalk Application and Environment using the 
[AWS document](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/elasticbeanstalk/latest/dg/create_deploy_go.html).

* Give the Elastic Beanstalk Environment permissions to create and read DynamoDB
tables:
 
  * For the Elastic Beanstalk Environment role (default: `aws-elasticbeanstal-ec2-role`), attach the 
  [AmazonDynamoDBFullAccess](https://console.aws.amazon.com/iam/home#/policies/arn:aws:iam::aws:policy/AmazonDynamoDBFullAccess$serviceLevelSummary) permission policy.

* Upload the ``aws-eb-swan-demo.zip`` bundle to the environment.

* Add an A record for each of the domains to direct traffic to the Elastic 
Beanstalk environment following the 
[AWS documentation](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/Route53/latest/DeveloperGuide/routing-to-beanstalk-environment.html).

* The SWAN access domain will be used to sign all the outgoing Open Web IDs and
also to capture people's preferences. Register this domain with the following
URL and entering any of the details requested. This will create a record in the 
``owidcreators`` table for the domain which will contain randomly generated 
public and private signing keys.

  ```
  https://swan-access-domain/owid/register
  ```

* For each of the storage nodes that will be used for the SWIFT component of the
demo register these using the following URL. Enter the network as "swan" (no 
quotes) to match the value provided in the ``appsettings.json`` in the 
``swanNetwork`` field. Leave the others as default.

  ```
  https://swift-node-domain/swift/register
  ```

* At least one SWIFT access node is required. Repeat the previous process but 
select the "Access Node" option rather than the default "Storage Node". The 
records from these steps will be visible in the ``swiftnodes`` and 
``swiftsecrets`` tables.

* Verify the demo is working by navigating to the publisher domain. The first 
request from a web browser will result in the progress circle as SWIFT nodes
are navigated between before the preference capture page from the SWAN domain
is displayed.

## Azure App Service - with Docker

Azure App Services do not support the Go runtime natively so for deployment, Docker
containers are used. 

Azure can be used to host docker containers using Azure Container Registries. These
can then be referenced by an App Service to pull containers from.

### Pre-requisites

* Local Go version 1.15 or greater installation sufficient to run the Go command
line.

* Familiar with the concepts associated with 
[SWAN](https://github.com/SWAN-community/swan),
[SWIFT](https://github.com/SWAN-community/swift), and 
[OWID](https://github.com/SWAN-community/owid).

* Docker Engine - https://docs.docker.com/get-docker/

* Azure subscription with the ability to create App Services, Container Registries, DNS Zones and SSL Certificates

#### Azure

* Setup Azure container registry to push the demo Docker container to.
  * [Creating a container registry](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/container-registry/container-registry-get-started-portal)
  * [Enable Admin Authentication](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/container-registry/container-registry-authentication#admin-account)

* Setup domains to use with the demo in Azure using 
[App Service Domains](https://portal.azure.com/#blade/HubsExtension/BrowseResourceBlade/resourceType/Microsoft.DomainRegistration%2Fdomains). Domains are needed for the 
following roles.

    * SWAN access domain. For example ``51da.uk``.

    * Each of the SWIFT nodes that will support SWAN. At least two domains are 
    needed. For the purposes of the demo they may be sub domains. For example
    ``51da.uk`` and ``51db.uk``.

    * At least two different domains for publishers. For example 
    ``new-pork-limes.uk`` and ``current-bun.uk``.

    * At least two different domains for marketers. For example 
    ``cool-bikes.uk`` and ``cool-creams.uk``.

    * A domain for SSPs, Exchanges, DPSs and CMPs. For the purposes of the demo they can be sub domains. For example ``dsp.swan-demo.uk`` amd ``cmp.swan-demo.uk``

* Setup SSL certificates in Azure using 
[App Service Certificates](https://portal.azure.com/#blade/HubsExtension/BrowseResource/resourceType/Microsoft.CertificateRegistration%2FcertificateOrders) 
for each of the domains.

* Create a place to store SWAN demo data using a [Storage Account](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/storage/common/storage-account-create?tabs=azure-portal)

#### Windows

* Set powershell unrestricted execution policy to enable `build.ps1` to execute.
  Use the following command with administrator privileges.

  `Set-ExecutionPolicy Unrestricted`

### Steps

* Get all the dependencies needed by the Go application.

  `go get -d ./...`

  `dep.ps1` can also be used in Powershell to explicitly get the dependencies 
  for this Go application.

* Add the demo domain names as folder names to the www folder. For example; the
domain `domain.com` would appear as `www/domain.com`. Alter the `config.json` 
content in each folder to indicate the purpose of the domain. This aspect of 
the demo is changing and domain examples provided with the should be reviewed 
along with the demo source code and comments to understand how multiple domains
are supported within a single demo application.

* You may need to support multiple SSL certificates if the demo deployment 
should respond to five or more domains. 
See Azure [documentation](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/app-service/configure-ssl-certificate#import-an-app-service-certificate).

* Copy or rename ``/Dockerfile.rename`` to ``/Dockerfile`` and modify the `ENV` 
values for your environment. 

  * See [Manage storage account access keys](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/storage/common/storage-account-keys-manage#view-account-access-keys) on how to view and 
  retrieve access keys for your target storage account.

* Run the build.ps1 (Windows) or build.sh (Linux) to create the Docker image.
The image should contain the ``application`` executable compiled for Linux 64 
bit, the ``appsetings.json`` file and the ``www`` folder with directories for 
all the domains the demo will respond to. Note the SWIFT domains used for 
storage do not need to be present in the www folder.

* Before you can push the image to your Azure Container Registry (ACR) you will 
need to tag the image using the docker tag command. Replace <login-server> with 
the login server name of your ACR instance.

  ```
  docker tag swan-community/swan-demo-go <login-server>/swan-demo-go:latest
  ```

* Push the container to the ACR instance. 
  ```
  docker push <login-server>/swan-demo-go:latest
  ```

* Create a new App Service - see [Deploy and run a containerized web app with Azure App Service](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/learn/modules/deploy-run-container-app-service/5-exercise-deploy-web-app?pivots=csharp)

  * Go to the [Azure portal](https://portal.azure.com/) and select Create a resource. 

  * Search for and select Web App.

  * On the Basics tab, configure the values. The following values are for guidance:
    |Setting|Value|
    |-|-|
    |Resource Group|Select the resource group to use or create a new one.|
    |Name|e.g. swan-demo-go-app|
    |Publish|Docker Container|
    |OS|Linux|
    |Region|Select the same location that is close to you from previous exercise.|
    |App Service Plan|Use the default.|

  * Select Next: Docker >.

  * On the Docker tab, use the following values as a guide for each setting.
    |Setting|Value|
    |-|-|
    |Options|Single Container|
    |Image Source|Azure Container Registry|
    |Registry|Select your registry.|
    |Image|swan-community/swan-demo-go|
    |Tag|latest|
    |Startup Command|Leave this setting empty.|

  * Select Review and create, and then select Create.
  
* Map each of the domains to direct traffic to the App Service following the 
[Azure documentation](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/app-service/app-service-web-tutorial-custom-domain#map-your-domain).

* The SWAN access domain will be used to sign all the outgoing Open Web IDs and
also to capture people's preferences. Register this domain with the following
URL and entering any of the details requested. This will create a record in the 
``owidcreators`` table for the domain which will contain randomly generated 
public and private signing keys. Do this for each SWAN access node and SWAN 
participant.

  ```
  https://swan-access-domain/owid/register
  ```

* For each of the storage nodes that will be used for the SWIFT component of the
demo register these using the following URL. Enter the network as "swan" (no 
quotes) to match the value provided in the ``appsettings.json`` in the 
``swanNetwork`` field. Leave the others as default.

  ```
  https://swift-node-domain/swift/register
  ```

* At least one SWIFT access node is required. Repeat the previous process but 
select the "Access Node" option rather than the default "Storage Node". The 
records from these steps will be visible in the ``swiftnodes`` and 
``swiftsecrets`` tables.

* Verify the demo is working by navigating to a publisher domain. The first 
request from a web browser will result in the progress circle as SWIFT nodes
are navigated between before the preference capture page from the SWAN domain
is displayed.
